# subtitle renamer

## what's this?

I watch a lot of movies, and prefer original language
and subtitles (in English). My TV is not smart enough
to let me pick any subtitle, but the ones I get from the web
are hardly named the same as the movie file. It's not a big
thing when we're talking about single movies, but when it's a series, this becomes an issue.
To solve this and to practice some Java, I wrote this
program to do the hard work.
You can use it if you wish.

## how to use

So far it only works on a single folder with a single
.mkv and a single .srt file.
Just copy the path of the directory and hit "Go!".


## excuses

* JavaFX is very new to me, so I'm a bit slow at the beginning.
* Not even sure how to apply MVC structure.
* I just started advanced module, learning C from scratch.
* I'm lazy.
