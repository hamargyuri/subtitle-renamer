# subtitle renamer

### what's this?

I watch a lot of movies, and prefer original language
and subtitles (in English). My TV is not smart enough
to let me pick any subtitle, but the ones I get from the web
are hardly named the same as the movie file. It's not a big
thing when we're talking about single movies, but when it's a series, this becomes an issue.
To solve this and to practice some Java, I wrote this
program to do the hard work.
You can use it if you wish.
